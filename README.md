# Lung Cancer Detection | Python, K-Means, KNN, SVM	
•	Developed a machine learning-based Lung Cancer Detection system using K-Means for clustering, KNN for classification/prediction, and SVM for classification/regression.
•	Pre-processed medical data, performed model selection and training, and evaluated model performance for accurate predictions.
•	Implemented the solution using Python, demonstrating a strong understanding of data handling and machine learning techniques.
